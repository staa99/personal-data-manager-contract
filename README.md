# Basic Smart Contract

This is my first attempt at building a smart contract.
I followed a course on buildspace.so to learn the basics of solidity 
and this is my first attempt putting that knowledge to use.

If you are kind enough to read through and find any 'screaming' bad practices, 
please let me know so I can learn how best to do things instead.
